Completed website using flask but was unsuccessful in rendering the video

Day 2: Re-styled website with video. Logo issues due to transparency -- Linked up to SQL database in PGAdmin

Day 3: Added responsiveness to Signin and Signup nav bars. Made logo transparent so it fits more smoothly onto the video. 

Day 4: Updated responsiveness to Signin and Signup nav bars and created CRUD API routes allowing "CREATE", "RETRIEVE", "UPDATE", and "DELETE." PGAdmin updates with added info from Insomnia.exe.
