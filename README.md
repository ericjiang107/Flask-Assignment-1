Day 3: Added responsiveness to Signin and Signup nav bars. Made logo transparent so it fits more smoothly onto the video. 

Day 4: Updated responsiveness to Signin and Signup nav bars and created CRUD API routes allowing "CREATE", "RETRIEVE", "UPDATE", and "DELETE." PGAdmin updates with added info from Insomnia.exe.
